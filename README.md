# Channel Analysis Toolbox (CAT)
Matlab toolbox for pre-processing and analysis of channels from any source, such as EEG, MEG or fMRI.
Pre-processing functions are only provided for EEG, analysis for any data organised in a CAT struct.

# Generic Function Toolbox (GFT)
Generic functions used by CAT but usable anywhere.

# Installation
To install CAT in Matlab, add both folders with subfolders to your Matlab path.
CAT also depends on functions from EEGLab2024 and SPM12, so these need to be installed. Older
versions of these toolboxes will probably also work.
